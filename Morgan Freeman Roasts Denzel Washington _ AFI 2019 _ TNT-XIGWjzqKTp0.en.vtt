00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:09.540
 40 years ago, 1979, Denzel
and I were in a Joseph Papp

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.090
production of "Coriolanus."

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.379
I was the lead.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.516
Denzel was a stage prop.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.410
Now, he has publicly
said many times

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.700
that during rehearsal he came to
me with questions, suggestions

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.000
about how we should play
a sword fight scene that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.730
could be extended with
some extra stabbing

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.820
and wounding and [MUTED].

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.170
He said that I looked at
him, after asking his name,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.510
and I told him this--

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.480
kid, we click
swords three times,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.664
I stab you, you
fall down and die.

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:02.508
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.550
I'm going to tell you
the correct story.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.290
What I actually
said to Denzel was--

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.320
you're that
brilliant young actor

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.252
just out of Fordham University.

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:21.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.660
That was a great suggestion.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.496
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.650
Joe Papp never thought of it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.310
Hell, Shakespeare didn't
think of that one.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.770
Clearly, you know better
than the two of them

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.270
how this thing should be staged.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.635
What a fine eye for action--

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.080
I think you have a bright
career ahead of you.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.440
And I hope one day to perhaps
work with you in a film.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.250
But until then, you get
back where you belong.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.500
When you come out on stage,
we click swords three times.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.168
I stab you, and you
fall down and die.

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:15.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.100
Now, I'm much too
young to remember

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.910
the very first AFI Life
Achievement Award back in 1973.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.330
But I'm pretty sure of this.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.500
When they created this award,
Denzel Hayes Washington Jr

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
was waiting in the wings.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.870
Denzel, my dear friend,
congratulations.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.920
[APPLAUSE]
